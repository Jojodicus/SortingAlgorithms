# SortingAlgorithms
A (hopefully sorted) list of sorting algorithms to sort your list of sorting algorithms!

### currently supported:
* Bubblesort
* Heapsort
* Insertionsort
* Mergesort
* Quicksort
* RadixBit
* Selectionsort

## usage of Main class
The Main class is used for testing the algorithms. It can either test all algorithms, or specific ones.

As is, it will test any algorithm **20** times with **10** randomly shuffled numbers.\
These values can be changed in the source if needed.

After compiling,
`java Main`
will test every algorithm.

Using the program args a selecton of specific algorithms is possible.\
Example: 
`java Main Bubble Merge` 
will test Bubblesort and Mergesort
